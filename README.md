# Welcome To My Nostr Blog


Nostr is a protocol which stands for Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted Over Relay.


## What?

The idea is to own your own data.

### How?

When you create a private nostr key, only the owner of that private key can create notes and other stuff.
You use your private key to sign these notes.

These notes are json objects.

Anyone who follows your public key can read your notes...
Unless you send the note as a NIP04 private message.

These notes are encrypted to someone else's public key. 

Only that person can decipher that message, although anyone can see you sent him or her a message. They just can't read it.

 ** These notes are Transmitted Over Relay **

There are hundreds of relays.

There are dozens of clients. 

Most of the clients are twitter like websites or apps.

There is also a chess client.

A Instagram like clients called nostrgram.co

We could also run calendars and GIT.

#### No, There's No Blockchain 

The bitcoin time chain(not blockchain) is an amazing, elegant solution to the double spending problem. 
This makes the bitcoin time chain a censorship resistant alternative  to central banks.
Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited.
There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin.
This makes it almost impossible to debase.

This is awesome for money, but we don't need that much security to post cat pictures. 

Nostr is censorship resistant.

No one company or person can censor
